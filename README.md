# Deep Audio-Visual Speech Recognition

The repository contains a PyTorch reproduction of the [Deep Audio-Visual Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02108) paper.


## Changes Required
- Adding ignored files to github, unsetting git credentials
- removing the non-word regions in the data by observing the time
- going through github code
- commenting the code (do it last since editing the comments is a PITA)
- noisy audio in av training
- deleting all wav and png files from dataset at last
- trying test time augmentation
- noisy training (audio/video/both) at the end if needed
